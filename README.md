# HuffmanCode

Code that implements a simple huffman algorithm. 


	To run the program

	1) Compression
	
		*If you already got the execute file in directory jump to item c)
		a) Open a terminal, and run in directory:
			$make
		
		b) An output named 'saida' will be created.
		
		c) Then, run:
			$./saida -c file_to_be_compress.ext output_compressed
		
		d) Your file will be compressed.
		
	2) Decompression
	
		*If you already got the execute file in directory jump to item c)
		a) Open a terminal, and run in directory:
			$make
		
		b) An output named 'saida' will be created.
		
		c) Then, run:
			$./saida -x file_to_be_decompress.ext original_output
		
		d) Your original file will be retrieve.
